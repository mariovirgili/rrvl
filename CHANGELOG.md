# 20200905

- ogage (global events daemon) further optimized to use basically 0% CPU

# 20200904

- Fix SDL2 controller mappings (this doesn't mean you definitely don't need to
  remap in SDL apps!)
- ppsspp recompiled against SDL2-2.0.10 for compatibility
- New directory `/roms/_rrvl` for system managed scripts. This is where you'll
  find update.sh and standalone launchers like ppsspp.sh. Users should use
  another directory such as /roms/sh for their own scripts.
- Fixed libGLESv2 issue that prevented dreamcast from running.
- NOTE: You will *need* to remap PPSSPP controls. We can't force v11 or v10
  mapping by default for obvious reasons. You just need to do this once.
- Wifi powersave is disabled in NetworkManager. Thanks to @pyghast for testing.

# 20200903

- Port wifi disable power savings from RR
- ppsspp-odroidgo2 now replaces ppsspp-go2. You may have to run
  `sudo xbps-install -Su ppsspp-odroidgo2` to install it.

# 20200902

- ppsspp-odroidgo2 update to include speedup patch

# 20200901
